With the crackle of frost in the air, there emerged;
While trading in a bustling market town, you are ambushed by;
As the Norns wove their icy threads, there appeared;

Emerging from the snow's embrace was;
From the frost-shrouded mist came;
From the churning waves of the fjords arose;
Through the blizzard's howl emerged;

Journeying through treacherous mountain passes, you come face to face with;
Amidst the swirling smoke of the longhouse, strides forth;
From the prow of his longship emerged;
Carried on the whispering winds that sweep through the village streets, appears;
Amidst the ruins of an ancient battlefield, you awaken;
