From the snowstorm emerged;
Through the blizzard's fury emerged;
From the swirling snow emerged;
Emerging from the icy tempest was;
Through the whiteout stepped;
From the frosty haze appeared;
Through the biting winds emerged;
From the frost-shrouded mist came;
Through the blizzard's howl emerged;
From the snowstorm's grip appeared;
Emerging from the snow's embrace was;
Unveiled by the blizzard's cloak strode; 
Birthed from the storm's wrath came;
Carved from the snow's fury emerged;
Unveiled by the blizzard's dance approached;
Born from the snowstorm's rage appeared;
From the frozen tempest emerged;
Forged from the blizzard's embrace emerged;
Cast from the snowstorm's heart appeared;
Unveiled by the blizzard's breath strode;
Born from the storm's fury emerged;
As the northern winds whispered secrets, there emerged;
From the icy depths of Niflheim, there strode forth;
Born amidst the swirling blizzard, there appeared;
From the frozen peaks of Jotunheim, there descended;
With each snowflake a prophecy, there emerged;
From the ancient glaciers' depths, there rose;
As the aurora danced overhead, there emerged;
Carried on the icy breath of winter, there appeared;
From the depths of winter's fury, there strode forth;
With the crackle of frost in the air, there emerged;
From the churning waves of the fjords arose; 
As the Valkyries sang their mournful song, there emerged;
From the depths of the icy sea, there rose;
Carried on the winds of Niflheim, there strode forth;
From the halls of Niflheim's frozen peaks emerged;
As the northern lights danced overhead, there appeared;
With each step leaving frost-cracked earth, there came;
Born beneath Yggdrasil's icy roots, there came;
From the depths of Jotunheim's frozen caves emerged;
From the prow of his longship emerged;
As the snow whispered tales of old, there appeared;
Carried on the breath of the frost giants, there came;
From the depths of winter's grasp emerged;
As the Norns wove their icy threads, there appeared;
Born beneath the gaze of Fenrir's icy eye, there came;
From the hearth of the village, amidst tales of frost, emerged;
Born beneath the towering pines of their ancestral lands, there strode forth;
From the frozen fields where the crops stubbornly grow, there appeared;
As the villagers sang songs of old, echoing through the frosty air, there appeared;
From the warmth of the village hearth, emerges;
Amidst the flickering flames of the longhouse fires, steps forth;
Born beneath the towering pines that whisper tales of old, strides;
From the icy shores where the sea meets the land, rises;
Carried on the chilling winds that sweep across the frozen tundra, appears;
From the frost-covered fields where the crops stubbornly cling to life, emerges;
As the villagers' songs echo through the frost-kissed air, arrives;
Born beneath the watchful gaze of the village totems, stands;
Amidst the laughter and camaraderie of the longhouse, strides forth;
Born beneath the watchful gaze of the village elders, steps;
From the frozen shores where the waves crash against the icy cliffs, rises;
Carried on the whispering winds that sweep through the village streets, appears;
As the ancient sagas are sung in the flickering firelight, arrives;
Patrolling the snow-covered streets with a watchful eye is; 
Appearing on the whispering winds that sweep through the village streets is;
Stepping forth from the shadows of the village elders is;
From ancient stones imparts wisdom;
From the village's heart emerges;
From the ancient stones that mark the center of the village, imparts wisdom;
Amidst the swirling smoke of the longhouse, strides forth;
From the heart of the village, where the fires burn bright, emerges;
While sailing along the icy fjords, your longship is ambushed by;
In a coastal village, you stumble upon;
As you traverse a dense forest, you are confronted;
During a feast in your own longhouse, someone arrives, it was;
Journeying through treacherous mountain passes, you come face to face with;
While trading in a bustling market town, you are ambushed by;
Amidst the ruins of an ancient battlefield, you awaken;
From the sea's frothy embrace emerged;
Born of frost and fjord, there came;
